Welcome to my website! [![Visitor](https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/badge?page_id=zlwu92.zlwu92.github.io)](https://github.com/zlwu92/zlwu92.github.io)

Hi! This is Zhenlin Wu, who is currently working in industry as a HPC engineer in Baidu Shanghai Paddle-Lite inference engine group, mainly focusing on optimizing the OPs and framework's performance for various hardware mobile platforms as well as adaptive input-shape awareness. From January 2018 to January 2019, I have been to dept of ECE at University of Massachusetts at Lowell for research and study, with my focus on High Performance Graph Computing. I got a paper published related to BFS acceleration on GPUs on HPDC'19. Prior to that, I received my Master's degree in Pure Mathematics from Capital Normal University and my Bachelor's degree in Information and Computing Science (Applied Mathematics) from Beijing Jiaotong University.
