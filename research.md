Generally speaking, my research interests center around areas of HPC, computer architecture, GPU parallel computing as well as compiling techniques. My current research focus on domain-specific/general graph compilers.

I hope to go deep into projects related to parallel computing systems fields, and I hope myself oneday can be a researcher who dedicates to building high performance and reliable softwares that are served for solving real industry issues or large-scale scientific computing problems. Also, it’s an exciting time to be a computer architect! Nowadays, advances rely on Moore’s Law during past decades are approaching their physical limits. To increase the efficiency of our devices and enable novel applications, it is necessary to build new hardware and computing systems. I believe next-generation computing systems’ performance improvements will bring the world amazing things and now it is up to computer architects to enable the next wave of revolutionary applications. Especially, I would like to work on architectural changes to future general-purpose hardware accelerators like GPUs.
